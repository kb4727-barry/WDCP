    <h1>Introduction to Web Design</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kadiatou Barry and I am a second year at New York University currently studying abroad at the NYU London campus. I am a Computer Science major and policy management minor. I am interested in all things tech. So far I am not sure what specific career I'd like to pursue in tech, therefore I am currently exploring different experiences through internships. I am very excited for this opportunity to study abroad at the ripe age of 19. I know there's so much to expereince and great memories to be made. </p>
